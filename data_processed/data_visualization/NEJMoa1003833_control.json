{"Answer": "Azithromycin and the Risk of Cardiovascular Death\n\nAlthough several macrolide antibiotics are proarrhythmic and associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death , azithromycin is thought to have minimal cardiotoxicity . However , published reports of arrhythmias suggest that azithromycin may increase the risk of cardiovascular death .\n\nWe studied a Tennessee Medicaid cohort designed to detect an increased risk of death related to short-term cardiac effects of medication , excluding patients with serious noncardiovascular illness and person-time during and shortly after hospitalization . The cohort included patients who took azithromycin ( 347,795 prescriptions ) , propensity-score -- matched persons who took no antibiotics ( 1,391,180 control periods ) , and patients who took amoxicillin ( 1,348,672 prescriptions ) , ciprofloxacin ( 264,626 prescriptions ) , or levofloxacin ( 193,906 prescriptions ) .\n\nDuring 5 days of therapy , patients taking azithromycin , as compared with those who took no antibiotics , had an increased risk of cardiovascular death ( hazard ratio , 2.88 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.79 to 4.63 ; P ( 0.001 ) and death from any cause ( hazard ratio , 1.85 ; 95 % CI , 1.25 to 2.75 ; P = 0.002 ) . Patients who took amoxicillin had no increase in the risk of death during this period . Relative to amoxicillin , azithromycin was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death ( hazard ratio , 2.49 ; 95 % CI , 1.38 to 4.50 ; P = 0.002 ) and death from any cause ( hazard ratio , 2.02 ; 95 % CI , 1.24 to 3.30 ; P = 0.005 ) , with an estimated 47 additional cardiovascular deaths per 1 million courses ; patients in the highest decile of risk for cardiovascular disease had an estimated 245 additional cardiovascular deaths per 1 million courses . The risk of cardiovascular death was significantly greater with azithromycin than with ciprofloxacin but did not differ significantly from that with levofloxacin .\n\nDuring 5 days of azithromycin therapy , there was a small absolute increase in cardiovascular deaths , which was most pronounced among patients with a high baseline risk of cardiovascular disease .
