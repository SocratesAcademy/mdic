{"Answer": "First Results of Phase 3 Trial of RTS,S/AS01 Malaria Vaccine in African Children\n\nAn ongoing phase 3 study of the efficacy , safety , and immunogenicity of candidate malaria vaccine RTS , S\\/AS01 is being conducted in seven African countries .\n\nFrom March 2009 through January 2011 , we enrolled 15,460 children in two age categories -- 6 to 12 weeks of age and 5 to 17 months of age -- for vaccination with either RTS , S\\/AS01 or a non-malaria comparator vaccine . The primary end point of the analysis was vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria during the 12 months after vaccination in the first 6000 children 5 to 17 months of age at enrollment who received all three doses of vaccine according to protocol . After 250 children had an episode of severe malaria , we evaluated vaccine efficacy against severe malaria in both age categories .\n\nIn the 14 months after the first dose of vaccine , the incidence of first episodes of clinical malaria in the first 6000 children in the older age category was 0.32 episodes per person-year in the RTS , S\\/AS01 group and 0.55 episodes per person-year in the control group , for an efficacy of 50.4 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 45.8 to 54.6 ) in the intention-to-treat population and 55.8 % ( 97.5 % CI , 50.6 to 60.4 ) in the per-protocol population . Vaccine efficacy against severe malaria was 45.1 % ( 95 % CI , 23.8 to 60.5 ) in the intention-to-treat population and 47.3 % ( 95 % CI , 22.4 to 64.2 ) in the per-protocol population . Vaccine efficacy against severe malaria in the combined age categories was 34.8 % ( 95 % CI , 16.2 to 49.2 ) in the per-protocol population during an average follow-up of 11 months . Serious adverse events occurred with a similar frequency in the two study groups . Among children in the older age category , the rate of generalized convulsive seizures after RTS , S\\/AS01 vaccination was 1.04 per 1000 doses ( 95 % CI , 0.62 to 1.64 ) .\n\nThe RTS , S\\/AS01 vaccine provided protection against both clinical and severe malaria in African children .

The effect of the vaccine was 45.1% in the population that was intended to be treated and 47.3% in the per-protocol population.
