{"Answer": "Effect of Sibutramine on Cardiovascular Outcomes in Overweight and Obese Subjects\n\nThe long-term effects of sibutramine treatment on the rates of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death among subjects at high cardiovascular risk have not been established .\n\nWe enrolled in our study 10,744 overweight or obese subjects , 55 years of age or older , with preexisting cardiovascular disease , type 2 diabetes mellitus , or both to assess the cardiovascular consequences of weight management with and without sibutramine in subjects at high risk for cardiovascular events . All the subjects received sibutramine in addition to participating in a weight-management program during a 6-week , single-blind , lead-in period , after which 9804 subjects underwent random assignment in a double-blind fashion to sibutramine ( 4906 subjects ) or placebo ( 4898 subjects ) .
