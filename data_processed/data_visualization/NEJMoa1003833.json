{"Answer": "Azithromycin and the Risk of Cardiovascular Death\n\nAlthough several macrolide antibiotics are proarrhythmic and associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death , azithromycin is thought to have minimal cardiotoxicity . However , published reports of arrhythmias suggest that azithromycin may increase the risk of cardiovascular death .\n\nWe studied a Tennessee Medicaid cohort designed to detect an increased risk of death related to short-term cardiac effects of medication , excluding patients with serious noncardiovascular illness and person-time during and shortly after hospitalization . The cohort included patients who took azithromycin ( 347,795 prescriptions ) , propensity-score -- matched persons who took no antibiotics ( 1,391,180 control periods ) , and patients who took amoxicillin ( 1,348,672 prescriptions ) , ciprofloxacin ( 264,626 prescriptions ) , or levofloxacin ( 193,906 prescriptions ) .\n\nDuring 5 days of therapy , patients taking azithromycin , as compared with those who took no antibiotics , had an increased risk of cardiovascular death ( hazard ratio , 2.88 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.79 to 4.63 ; P ( 0.001 ) and death from any cause ( hazard ratio , 1.85 ; 95 % CI , 1.25 to 2.75 ; P = 0.002 ) . Patients who took amoxicillin had no increase in the risk of death during this period . Relative to amoxicillin , azithromycin was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death ( hazard ratio , 2.49 ; 95 % CI , 1.38 to 4.50 ; P = 0.002 ) and death from any cause ( hazard ratio , 2.02 ; 95 % CI , 1.24 to 3.30 ; P = 0.005 ) , with an estimated 47 additional cardiovascular deaths per 1 million courses ; patients in the highest decile of risk for cardiovascular disease had an estimated 245 additional cardiovascular deaths per 1 million courses . The risk of cardiovascular death was significantly greater with azithromycin than with ciprofloxacin but did not differ significantly from that with levofloxacin .\n\nDuring 5 days of azithromycin therapy , there was a small absolute increase in cardiovascular deaths , which was most pronounced among patients with a high baseline risk of cardiovascular disease .

It is believed that azithromycin is less harmful to the heart than most macrolides, but reports do exist that suggest it still increases risk of cardiovascular death. A study was done on Tennessee Medicaid patients to assess risk of cardiac-related death due to medication. This included patients taking azithromycin, amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, as well as a control group taking no medication.\rPatients in the azithromycin group had a higher risk of cardiovascular-related death, and a higher risk of death from any cause than the amoxicillin group. The azithromycin group also had a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular death than the ciprofloxacin group. There was no significant difference in risk of death between azithromycin and levofloxacin groups. In conclusion, azithromycin treatment led to slightly increased risk of cardiovascular death. Patients with a high baseline risk of cardiovascular disease showed the highest increase in incidence of cardiovascular death.", "AssignmentId": "3R0T90IZ1TXMYODH1D8M3IGA7SUGC9", "Question": "NEJMoa1003833", "WorkerId": "A3QFXP9WDS19PR", "Qualification": 0.8461538461538461, "Topic": "cardio", "Hop": 0, "Education": "College", "Gender": "female", "Age": "15-24", "level": 1, "branch": "NEJMoa1003833", "Tagging": {"Coarse": {"azithromycin": ["Intervention"], "cardiovascular death": ["Outcomes"], "death from any because": ["Outcomes"], "tennessee": ["Participants"], "amoxicillin": ["Intervention"], "ciprofloxacin": ["Intervention"], "levofloxacin": ["Intervention"]}, "Fine": {"azithromycin": ["Intervention-general"], "cardiovascular death": ["Outcomes-general"], "death from any because": ["Outcomes-general"], "tennessee": ["Location"], "amoxicillin": ["Control"], "ciprofloxacin": ["Control"], "levofloxacin": ["Control"]}}, "Doggos_crowd": {"Coarse": {"Participants": ["C", "A", "B"], "Intervention": ["A", "C", "A"], "Outcomes": ["A", "C"], "Conclusion": ["A"]}, "Fine": {"Condition": ["C"], "Location": ["A"], "Sample-size": ["B"], "Intervention-general": ["A"], "Duration": ["C"], "Control": ["A"], "Outcomes-general": ["A"], "Effect-strength": ["C"], "Conclusion-general": ["A"]}}, "id": "NEJMoa1003833_3R0T90IZ1TXMYODH1D8M3IGA7SUGC9", "children": [{"Answer": "Out of all the macrolides used in medicinal practices, azithromycin is one of the least harmful.
