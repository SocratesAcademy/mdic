{"Answer": "Exemestane for Breast-Cancer Prevention in Postmenopausal Women\n\nTamoxifen and raloxifene have limited patient acceptance for primary prevention of breast cancer . Aromatase inhibitors prevent more contralateral breast cancers and cause fewer side effects than tamoxifen in patients with early-stage breast cancer .\n\nIn a randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial of exemestane designed to detect a 65 % relative reduction in invasive breast cancer , eligible postmenopausal women 35 years of age or older had at least one of the following risk factors : 60 years of age or older ; Gail 5-year risk score greater than 1.66 % ( chances in 100 of invasive breast cancer developing within 5 years ) ; prior atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ ; or ductal carcinoma in situ with mastectomy . Toxic effects and health-related and menopause-specific qualities of life were measured .\n\nA total of 4560 women for whom the median age was 62.5 years and the median Gail risk score was 2.3 % were randomly assigned to either exemestane or placebo . At a median follow-up of 35 months , 11 invasive breast cancers were detected in those given exemestane and in 32 of those given placebo , with a 65 % relative reduction in the annual incidence of invasive breast cancer ( 0.19 % vs. 0.55 % ; hazard ratio , 0.35 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.18 to 0.70 ; P = 0.002 ) .
