{"Answer": "Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet\n\nObservational cohort studies and a secondary prevention trial have shown an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular risk . We conducted a randomized trial of this diet pattern for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events .\n\nIn a multicenter trial in Spain , we randomly assigned participants who were at high cardiovascular risk , but with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment , to one of three diets : a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil , a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts , or a control diet ( advice to reduce dietary fat ) . Participants received quarterly individual and group educational sessions and , depending on group assignment , free provision of extra-virgin olive oil , mixed nuts , or small nonfood gifts . The primary end point was the rate of major cardiovascular events ( myocardial infarction , stroke , or death from cardiovascular causes ) . On the basis of the results of an interim analysis , the trial was stopped after a median follow-up of 4.8 years .\n\nA total of 7447 persons were enrolled ( age range , 55 to 80 years ) ; 57 % were women . The two Mediterranean-diet groups had good adherence to the intervention , according to self-reported intake and biomarker analyses . A primary end-point event occurred in 288 participants . The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were 0.70 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.54 to 0.92 ) and 0.72 ( 95 % CI , 0.54 to 0.96 ) for the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil ( 96 events ) and the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with nuts ( 83 events ) , respectively , versus the control group ( 109 events ) .
