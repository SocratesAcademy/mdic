All the subjects received sibutramine in addition to participating in a weight-management program during a 6-week , single-blind , lead-in period , after which 9804 subjects underwent random assignment in a double-blind fashion to sibutramine ( 4906 subjects ) or placebo ( 4898 subjects ) .

The mean weight loss during the lead-in period was 2.6 kg ; after randomization , the subjects in the sibutramine group achieved and maintained further weight reduction ( mean , 1.7 kg ) . The mean blood pressure decreased in both groups , with greater reductions in the placebo group than in the sibutramine group ( mean difference , 1.2 \\/ 1.4 mm Hg ) .
