{"Answer": "Response to a Monovalent 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) Vaccine\n\nA novel 2009 influenza A ( H1N1 ) virus is responsible for the first influenza pandemic in 41 years . A safe and effective vaccine is needed . A randomized , observer-blind , parallel-group trial evaluating two doses of an inactivated , split-virus 2009 H1N1 vaccine in healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years is ongoing at a single site in Australia .\n\nWe evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine after each of two scheduled doses , administered 21 days apart . A total of 240 subjects , equally divided into two age groups ( ( 50 years and \u2265 50 years ) , were enrolled and underwent randomization to receive either 15 \u03bcg or 30 \u03bcg of hemagglutinin antigen by intramuscular injection . We measured antibody titers using hemagglutination-inhibition and microneutralization assays at baseline and 21 days after vaccination . The coprimary immunogenicity end points were the proportion of subjects with antibody titers of 1:40 or more on hemagglutination-inhibition assay , the proportion of subjects with either seroconversion or a significant increase in antibody titer , and the factor increase in the geometric mean titer .\n\nBy day 21 after the first dose , antibody titers of 1:40 or more were observed in 114 of 120 subjects ( 95.0 % ) who received the 15-\u03bcg dose and in 106 of 119 subjects ( 89.1 % ) who received the 30-\u03bcg dose . A similar result was observed after the second dose of vaccine . No deaths , serious adverse events , or adverse events of special interest were reported . Local discomfort ( e.g. , injection-site tenderness or pain ) was reported by 56.3 % of subjects , and systemic symptoms ( e.g. , headache ) by 53.8 % of subjects after each dose . Nearly all events were mild to moderate in intensity .\n\nA single 15-\u03bcg dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine was immunogenic in adults , with mild-to-moderate vaccine-associated reactions .
