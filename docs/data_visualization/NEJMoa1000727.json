{"Answer": "Effect of Screening Mammography on Breast-Cancer Mortality in Norway\n\nA challenge in quantifying the effect of screening mammography on breast-cancer mortality is to provide valid comparison groups . The use of historical control subjects does not take into account chronologic trends associated with advances in breast-cancer awareness and treatment .\n\nThe Norwegian breast-cancer screening program was started in 1996 and expanded geographically during the subsequent 9 years . Women between the ages of 50 and 69 years were offered screening mammography every 2 years . We compared the incidence-based rates of death from breast cancer in four groups : two groups of women who from 1996 through 2005 were living in counties with screening ( screening group ) or without screening ( nonscreening group ) ; and two historical-comparison groups that from 1986 through 1995 mirrored the current groups .\n\nWe analyzed data from 40,075 women with breast cancer . The rate of death was reduced by 7.2 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the screening group as compared with the historical screening group ( rate ratio , 0.72 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.63 to 0.81 ) and by 4.8 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the nonscreening group as compared with the historical nonscreening group ( rate ratio , 0.82 ; 95 % CI , 0.71 to 0.93 ; P ( 0.001 for both comparisons ) , for a relative reduction in mortality of 10 % in the screening group ( P = 0.13 ) . Thus , the difference in the reduction in mortality between the current and historical groups that could be attributed to screening alone was 2.4 deaths per 100,000 person-years , or a third of the total reduction of 7.2 deaths .\n\nThe availability of screening mammography was associated with a reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer , but the screening itself accounted for only about a third of the total reduction .

The challenge in quantifying the effects of mammograms on mortality was conducted in a nine year comparison study of over 40- thousand women aged 50 to 69 with breast cancer. They looked at the incidence in rates of death from the disease among those who had and had not been screened for breast cancer. The women were all offered a mammogram every two years. The data was analyzed between the two groups and showed the death rate was reduced by 7 deaths per 100,000 among those women in the screened group, and nearly 5 deaths in the non-screened group. This resulted in a relative reduction in mortality of 10% in the screening group.

Using past data was never helpful as it did not take into account things like then-current advances in breast cancer treatment and awareness. The Norwegian program offered women between the ages of 50 and 69 a mammogram every two years. They compared the results with similar groups of women who lived in other countries that provided screening, similar groups of women who lived in countries without screening and two historical groups that had similar experiences with screenings. They analyzed data from over 40,000 women with cancer of the breast. In all women who had screenings, the mortality rate was reduced by 7.2 deaths per 100,000 people. This reduced the death rate by 10%. This showed that screening does reduce the risk of death.
