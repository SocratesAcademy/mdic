{"Answer": "Effect of Three Decades of Screening Mammography on Breast-Cancer Incidence\n\nTo reduce mortality , screening must detect life-threatening disease at an earlier , more curable stage . Effective cancer-screening programs therefore both increase the incidence of cancer detected at an early stage and decrease the incidence of cancer presenting at a late stage .\n\nWe used Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results data to examine trends from 1976 through 2008 in the incidence of early-stage breast cancer ( ductal carcinoma in situ and localized disease ) and late-stage breast cancer ( regional and distant disease ) among women 40 years of age or older .\n\nThe introduction of screening mammography in the United States has been associated with a doubling in the number of cases of early-stage breast cancer that are detected each year , from 112 to 234 cases per 100,000 women -- an absolute increase of 122 cases per 100,000 women . Concomitantly , the rate at which women present with late-stage cancer has decreased by 8 % , from 102 to 94 cases per 100,000 women -- an absolute decrease of 8 cases per 100,000 women . With the assumption of a constant underlying disease burden , only 8 of the 122 additional early-stage cancers diagnosed were expected to progress to advanced disease . After excluding the transient excess incidence associated with hormone-replacement therapy and adjusting for trends in the incidence of breast cancer among women younger than 40 years of age , we estimated that breast cancer was overdiagnosed ( i.e. , tumors were detected on screening that would never have led to clinical symptoms ) in 1.3 million U.S. women in the past 30 years . We estimated that in 2008 , breast cancer was overdiagnosed in more than 70,000 women ; this accounted for 31 % of all breast cancers diagnosed .\n\nDespite substantial increases in the number of cases of early-stage breast cancer detected , screening mammography has only marginally reduced the rate at which women present with advanced cancer . Although it is not certain which women have been affected , the imbalance suggests that there is substantial overdiagnosis , accounting for nearly a third of all newly diagnosed breast cancers , and that screening is having , at best , only a small effect on the rate of death from breast cancer .\n\n", "Topic": "breast", "Question": "NEJMoa1206809", "level": 0, "branch": "NEJMoa1206809", "Tagging": {"Coarse": {"screen mammography": ["Intervention"], "breast cancer": ["Outcomes"], "three decade": ["Intervention"], "1976 through 2008": ["Intervention"], "early stage": ["Outcomes"], "late stage": ["Outcomes"], "woman": ["Participants"], "40": ["Participants"], "united states": ["Participants"], "8 %": ["Outcomes"], "8 case per 100,000": ["Outcomes"], "double": ["Outcomes"], "102 to 94": ["Outcomes"], "112 to 234": ["Outcomes"]}, "Fine": {"screen mammography": ["Intervention-general"], "breast cancer": ["Outcomes-general"], "three decade": ["Duration"], "1976 through 2008": ["Duration"], "early stage": ["Outcomes-general"], "late stage": ["Outcomes-general"], "woman": ["Sex"], "40": ["Age"], "united states": ["Location"], "8 %": ["Effect-strength"], "8 case per 100,000": ["Effect-strength"], "double": ["Effect-strength"], "102 to 94": ["Effect-strength"], "112 to 234": ["Effect-strength"]}}, "Doggos_crowd": {"Coarse": {"Participants": ["A", "A", "A"], "Intervention": ["A", "A"], "Outcomes": ["A", "A"], "Conclusion": ["A"]}, "Fine": {"Sex": ["A"], "Age": ["A"], "Condition": [], "Location": ["A"], "Sample-size": [], "Intervention-general": ["A"], "Duration": ["A"], "Intensity": [], "Control": [], "Outcomes-general": ["A"], "Effect-strength": ["A"], "Adverse-effects": [], "Conclusion-general": ["A"]}, "Count": 1}, "Doggos_text": {"Sex": "The participants were women.", "Age": "The participants were 40 years of age or older.", "Location": "The participants were from the United States.", "Intervention-general": "The study assessed the impact of screening mammography.", "Duration": "The screening mammography was offered for three decades (from 1976 to 2008).", "Outcomes-general": "The study measured the occurrences of early and late-stage breast cancers.", "Effect-strength": "The introduction of screening mammography was associated with a doubling in the number of cases of early stage breast cancer (from 112 to 234 cases per 100,000 women).
