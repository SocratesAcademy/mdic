{"Answer": "Comparison of Weight-Loss Diets with Different Compositions of Fat, Protein, and Carbohydrates\n\nThe possible advantage for weight loss of a diet that emphasizes protein , fat , or carbohydrates has not been established , and there are few studies that extend beyond 1 year .\n\nWe randomly assigned 811 overweight adults to one of four diets ; the targeted percentages of energy derived from fat , protein , and carbohydrates in the four diets were 20 , 15 , and 65 % ; 20 , 25 , and 55 % ; 40 , 15 , and 45 % ; and 40 , 25 , and 35 % . The diets consisted of similar foods and met guidelines for cardiovascular health . The participants were offered group and individual instructional sessions for 2 years . The primary outcome was the change in body weight after 2 years in two-by-two factorial comparisons of low fat versus high fat and average protein versus high protein and in the comparison of highest and lowest carbohydrate content .\n\nAt 6 months , participants assigned to each diet had lost an average of 6 kg , which represented 7 % of their initial weight ; they began to regain weight after 12 months . By 2 years , weight loss remained similar in those who were assigned to a diet with 15 % protein and those assigned to a diet with 25 % protein ( 3.0 and 3.6 kg , respectively ) ; in those assigned to a diet with 20 % fat and those assigned to a diet with 40 % fat ( 3.3 kg for both groups ) ; and in those assigned to a diet with 65 % carbohydrates and those assigned to a diet with 35 % carbohydrates ( 2.9 and 3.4 kg , respectively ) ( P ) 0.20 for all comparisons ) . Among the 80 % of participants who completed the trial , the average weight loss was 4 kg ; 14 to 15 % of the participants had a reduction of at least 10 % of their initial body weight . Satiety , hunger , satisfaction with the diet , and attendance at group sessions were similar for all diets ; attendance was strongly associated with weight loss ( 0.2 kg per session attended ) . The diets improved lipid-related risk factors and fasting insulin levels .\n\n Reduced-calorie diets result in clinically meaningful weight loss regardless of which macronutrients they emphasize .
