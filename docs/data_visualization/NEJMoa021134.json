{"Answer": "A Population-Based Study of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccination and Autism\n\nIt has been suggested that vaccination against measles , mumps , and rubella ( MMR ) is a cause of autism .\n\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of all children born in Denmark from January 1991 through December 1998 . The cohort was selected on the basis of data from the Danish Civil Registration System , which assigns a unique identification number to every live-born infant and new resident in Denmark . MMR-vaccination status was obtained from the Danish National Board of Health . Information on the children 's autism status was obtained from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register , which contains information on all diagnoses received by patients in psychiatric hospitals and outpatient clinics in Denmark . We obtained information on potential confounders from the Danish Medical Birth Registry , the National Hospital Registry , and Statistics Denmark .\n\nOf the 537,303 children in the cohort ( representing 2,129,864 person-years ) , 440,655 ( 82.0 percent ) had received the MMR vaccine . We identified 316 children with a diagnosis of autistic disorder and 422 with a diagnosis of other autistic-spectrum disorders . After adjustment for potential confounders , the relative risk of autistic disorder in the group of vaccinated children , as compared with the unvaccinated group , was 0.92 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.68 to 1.24 ) , and the relative risk of another autistic-spectrum disorder was 0.83 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.65 to 1.07 ) .
