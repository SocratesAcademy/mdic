{"Answer": "Association of Coffee Drinking with Total and Cause-Specific Mortality\n\nCoffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages , but the association between coffee consumption and the risk of death remains unclear .\n\nWe examined the association of coffee drinking with subsequent total and cause-specific mortality among 229,119 men and 173,141 women in the National Institutes of Health -- AARP Diet and Health Study who were 50 to 71 years of age at baseline . Participants with cancer , heart disease , and stroke were excluded . Coffee consumption was assessed once at baseline .\n\nDuring 5,148,760 person-years of follow-up between 1995 and 2008 , a total of 33,731 men and 18,784 women died . In age-adjusted models , the risk of death was increased among coffee drinkers . However , coffee drinkers were also more likely to smoke , and , after adjustment for tobacco-smoking status and other potential confounders , there was a significant inverse association between coffee consumption and mortality . Adjusted hazard ratios for death among men who drank coffee as compared with those who did not were as follows : 0.99 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 0.95 to 1.04 ) for drinking less than 1 cup per day , 0.94 ( 95 % CI , 0.90 to 0.99 ) for 1 cup , 0.90 ( 95 % CI , 0.86 to 0.93 ) for 2 or 3 cups , 0.88 ( 95 % CI , 0.84 to 0.93 ) for 4 or 5 cups , and 0.90 ( 95 % CI , 0.85 to 0.96 ) for 6 or more cups of coffee per day ( P ( 0.001 for trend ) ; the respective hazard ratios among women were 1.01 ( 95 % CI , 0.96 to 1.07 ) , 0.95 ( 95 % CI , 0.90 to 1.01 ) , 0.87 ( 95 % CI , 0.83 to 0.92 ) , 0.84 ( 95 % CI , 0.79 to 0.90 ) , and 0.85 ( 95 % CI , 0.78 to 0.93 ) ( P ( 0.001 for trend ) . Inverse associations were observed for deaths due to heart disease , respiratory disease , stroke , injuries and accidents , diabetes , and infections , but not for deaths due to cancer . Results were similar in subgroups , including persons who had never smoked and persons who reported very good to excellent health at baseline .\n\nIn this large prospective study , coffee consumption was inversely associated with total and cause-specific mortality .
